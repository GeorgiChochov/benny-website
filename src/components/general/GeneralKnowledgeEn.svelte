    <h1>Helpful facts about dogs</h1>
    <p>According to several behavioral measures, dogs’ mental abilities are close to a human child age 2 to
        2.5 years with an IQ of about a 100. The dog's breed determines some of its ability to learn and to work with
        its human. Golden retrievers are known for their impulse to please their humans and love to work. Their limited
        IQ however means that they aren't as smart as humans and do not understand commands and cues unless you train
        them properly. Dogs do not generalize as well as us humans do, in practise this means that just because they
        know a behaviour inside the house, doesn't mean that they know how to do the same thing in another environment
        (unless we train them to). More about this under "training".</p>
    <h2>Positive reinforcement</h2>
    <p>Dogs repeat behaviors that are rewarding for them. For example if you know that your dog always chew sticks at
        the same spot on the grass, you want to <b>foresee</b> the behaviour and prevent it - have them do something
        else instead. The more they learn to do something and get rewarded for it (chew sticks, barks etc) the more
        likely they are to do it. This also goes for good behaviour, if they learn that they get a treat everytime they
        sit - they are more likely to perform the behaviour. </p>
    <h3>Timing</h3>
    <p>Correct timing is essential when using positive reinforcement. The cue and reward must occur immediately (within
        seconds) of the desired behavior, or your pet may not associate it with the proper action. For example, if you
        have your dog sit but reward them after they’ve stood back up, they’ll think they’re being rewarded for
        standing.

    <h2>Body language</h2>
    <p>Learning to study a dog's body langauge is important because it tells you a lot about how they are doing. It can
        be difficult at first but you can normally see several things happening within a short period of time, for
        example yawning, lip licking and scratching.
        The first row in the picture to the right (green) shows a happy dog. The second row (blue), shows a worried dog.
        Additonally to this is also when the dog scratch - although sometimes they do this because something is actually
        scratching. On the third row (red) you can see a very stressed dog.
    </p>
    <p>Once you learn your dog's body language, you can help and guide them in different situations. You should never
        rush a dog showing signs of anxiety and stress. If you work through a tough situation for the dog together, this
        can strenghten your relationship and vice versa. </p>

    <h2>Adolecense</h2>
    <p>Large dogs mature slower than small dogs. For dogs at the same size as Benny, this means that they are teenagers
        for a longer time - usually between approx 6 months of age until about 2-3 years of age. The most difficult time
        is usually between 8-18 months. Teenage dogs is quite similar to teenage humans with hormone levels going up and
        down. This is a difficult time for the dog and sometimes it can feel like the dog has cotton in its ears. What
        is the most important here is to be patient, stick to positive reinforcement and be consistent with the dog. If
        your rule is that the dog can't jump up on the bed, you should <u>never</u> allow this. </p>

    <b>Typical behaviour during adolesence:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Very interested in scents </li>
        <li>Marks with urin more often</li>
        <li>Tries boundries, what happens if I ignore my owner/s?</li>
        <li>Easily distracted </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Just as with human teenagers, this phase might feel long but it will pass as long as you stay consistent and
        continue the training.</p>
