    <h1>Summer for dogs</h1>
    <p>The hot summer months for dogs can be tough. When the temperature goes over 20 celsius, you need to be extra
        cautious. Try to do a longer walk in the morning when it is cool and only do a very short walk during mid day to
        let the dog relieve themselves.
        Later in the evening, you can take a little longer walk if the dog seems active and energetic.</p>
    <p>Another thing that is important to keep in mind during spring and summer is to give the dog tick repellent,
        consult your veterinarian what repellent to use.</p>

    <h2>Making sure the dog is cool enough</h2>
    <p>It is very important to keep track so the dog doesn't get dehydrated or get a heat-stroke. Later down on this
        page you will see the symptoms.</p>
    <b></b>Here are some advice on what to do:</b>
    <br>
    <img class="ImageLeft" src="cooling_mat.jpg">
    <h3>Outdoors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Avoid walking on the hot asfalt in the sun when it is warm outside. Better to walk in the shade and/or on
            the grass. Keep the walks short and don't make the dog run or play outside.</li>
        <li>Bring fresh water on every walk and offer mid-walk</li>
        <li>Take pauses during the walk where the dog (and you) can rest</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Indoors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Turn on the AC indoors and put out the cooling mat</li>
        <li>After walks, take a wet towel and cool down the dog's belly and paws</li>
        <li>Make him lie on the cooling mat and offer fresh water, you can also spray him with water</li>
        <li>Let the dog rest</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3 class="h2">Be Alert to Dehydration and Heatstroke</h3>
    <p> A dog's normal temperature is approx 38.5 celsius. If the temperature reaches above 41 degrees, it is dangeorus
        for the dog.</p>

    <h4>Signs for dehydration in dogs </h4>
    <p> Dogs can become dehydrated when more fluids leave the body than it takes in. They lose fluids through
        panting,
        urinating, and even from evaporation through their paws. If you see any of the following symptoms, the dog
        needs
        rehydration and replacement of electrolytes as soon as possible:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Excessive Panting</li>
        <li>Dry gums and nose</li>
        <li>Thick saliva</li>
        <li>Lethargy</li>
        <li>Sunken eyes</li>
        <li>Loss of elasticity in the skin</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A quick check on hot days is to lift/pull out the scruff a little bit, it should instantly go back to normal.
        If
        it goes back slowly (slower than normal), the dog can be dehydrated. You should also check the mouth as
        mentioned above, the saliva should be wet and the gums should not be too pale nor too dark.</p>
    <p>In case you see signs of dehydration, just giving the dog water to drink might not be enough. You can make
        homemade fluid replacement on very hot days. <br><br><b>Recipe:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>500 ml water</li>
        <li>0.5 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>0.5 tablespoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up the water and put aside.</li>
        <li>Add salt and honey to the water and stir until desolved.</li>
        <li>Let cool and then give 1 tablespoon 2-3 times an hour.</li>
        <li>You can store the mixture in the refridgerator for a few days.</li>
        <li>If the dog wont drink it, you can add it to some cold chicken broth (boiled chicken).</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>Heatstroke</h4>
    <p>Heatstroke can be the serious and often fatal result of a dog’s prolonged exposure to excessive heat. Heatstroke
        usually occurs when high ambient temperature overcomes the dog’s ability to dissipate heat. The degree of damage
        is
        determined by how high a temperature is reached and how long the animal is exposed. Below are the signs of
        heatstroke and the actions you should take if your dog is overcome.</p>
    Early Stages of heatstroke: <br>
    <img class="imageRight" src="gum_color.jpg">
    <ul>
        <li>Heavy panting</li>
        <li>Rapid breathing</li>
        <li>Excessive drooling</li>
        <li>Bright red gums and tongue</li>
        <li>Difficulty maintaining balance</li>
    </ul>
    Advanced Stages:
    <ul>
        <li>White or blue gums</li>
        <li>Lethargy, unwillingness to move</li>
        <li>Uncontrollable urination or defecation</li>
        <li>Labored, noisy breathing</li>
        <li>Shock</li>
    </ul>

    <p> If you think the dog has a heatstroke, you need to <b>ACT FAST</b>. Make sure you contact your vet immediately.

    <p>While contacting the vets:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Move the dog to a shaded and cool area</li>
        <li> Keep them calm and still</li>
        <li>Put them on top of a cool wet towel, cooling mat or place them in the breeze of a fan</li>
        <li>Allow the dog to drink small amounts of cool water</li>
        <li>Pour cool water over the dog’s feet, ears and head. <u>Never</u> use ice or very cold water as this can
            cause shock</li>
        <li>Gradually start to move cool water over their body but not too much that they start shivering.</li>
        <li> If possible, continue cooling your dog on the way to your vet</li>
    </ul>
