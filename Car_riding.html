    <h1>Riding by car</h1>
    <p>Benny has never been very keen on going by car and this is common in dogs. It is always a good idea to tire the
        dog out a little before going by car. The dog <u>always</u> need to be fasten securely by a belt.
    </p>
    <p>Dogs are sensitive and can get car sick easily. You should therefore go very slow in turns and bumps and
        generally drive <b>slower</b>
        than you do without a dog in the car. Signs of stress in the car can be: panting, yawning and not taking treats.
        A good idea is to have someone in the backseat giving him some tube cheese to lick, as licking is calming for
        dogs. If you notice that the dog is stressed, make sure that the dog isn't too warm (turn on AC) and drive
        slower.
